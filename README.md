# practice-counter
A small app for tracking your success/failure rate while practicing something

To customize button names/count/hotkeys, edit the file `config.ini`. To add an entirely new button, add new name to the `buttons` list under `[SETTINGS]` and then add a new section with the same name under `[BUTTON2]`
